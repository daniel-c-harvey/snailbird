  "Preamble": "Making heavy industrial drums and bass sounds is something I've struggled with for a long time despite loving the style. \r\n This was a test of some ideas for a heavier rhythm section. The synth and drum parts are inspired by stamping plants, \r\n emergency alarms, and a sense of urgency and panic. I ended up loving the simple acid ostinato in 5/16 and the \r\n polymetric modulation that occurs as a result. I hope you enjoy too.",
